The holiday season is infamous for being a stressful time at the end of the year. As companies look forward to November to go "back-in-black" they will anticipate the largest amount of foot traffic through their stores and offer their best bargains in the shopping calendar. We want to help both customers plan their fastest route, and store managers plan the most lucrative store layout.
